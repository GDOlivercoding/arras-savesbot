/find Command Help

Filter and find saves based on options.

# **Options:**
- **screenshot-count**: Filter saves by the number of screenshots. Accepts exact numbers or comparison expressions (e.g., `>3`, `<=5`).
- **sub-mode**: Filter by the sub-mode (dirSortedMode) of the save. Choose from available modes.
- **tank-class**: Search for saves where the tank's name contains the specified text.
- **history-count**: Filter by the number of past saves. Supports comparison expressions.
- **score**: Filter by the save's score. Supports comparison expressions.
- **runtime-seconds**: Filter by the time spent alive (in seconds). Supports comparison expressions.

# **Comparison Expressions:**
You can use the following operators for numeric options:
- `>` (greater than)
- `<` (less than)
- `=` or `==` (equal to)
- `>=` (greater than or equal to)
- `<=` (less than or equal to)

`5`, `=5` and `==5` mean the exact same.

**Range Matching 1:**
For approximate matching, use the format `<range>value`, e.g., `<5>100` matches values between 95 and 105.

**Range Matching 2:**
For range matching, use the format `<min-max>`, e.g., `<10-20>` matches values between 10 and 20 (inclusive).

You are free to use commas and periods wherever for readability.
They won't change how the command functions.

**Examples:**
- `/find screenshot-count:>=1 score:<5.000.000`
- `/find tank-class:sniper runtime-seconds:>3600`
- `/find history-count:0 score:<200,000>1,000,000`
