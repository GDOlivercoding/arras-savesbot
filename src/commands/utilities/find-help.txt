- **screenshot-count**: Filter saves by the number of screenshots. type: NumberOrNumeralOperation 
- **sub-mode**: Filter by the sub-mode (dirSortedMode) of the save. Choose from available modes. type: Literal string
- **history-count**: Filter by the number of past saves. Supports comparison expressions. type: NumberOrNumeralOperation 
- **region**: Filter by the server region where the save was made. type: Literal string

- **match-code**: Match code parts. See below for details.

# Value Types

**NumberOrNumeralOperation:** (<|>|<=|>=)?<number>
option 1: Any decimal or hexadecimal (0x*) integer
option 2: You can use the following operators for numeric options:
- `>` (greater than)
- `<` (less than)
- `>=` (greater than or equal to)
- `<=` (less than or equal to)
- <operator><number>

option 3: `<number>number`, e.g., `<5>100` matches values between 95 and 105.

You are free to use commas and periods wherever for readability.
They won't change how the command functions.

**Matching Code Parts:**
All non-code parts are their own options (like region).
Use the `match-code` option to match code parts:
syntax: [key;value], [key;value], ...

key may be a string which one of the options below contain (kills, kill(s), (po)lygon(s)), 
or an index of the part in the code [0-14].

- Example: `[score;>1,000,000]` or `[6;>1,000,000]`
- Multiple pairs can be separated by commas: `[score;>=1,000,000],[kills;<10]`

**Value types for each option:** 
(index, name, type, notes)
- 0: id: unsupported, to get code by id use /view-save
- 1: server: string (server ID)
- 2: mode: string (gamemode)
- 3: tank: string, both user input and tank names get lower cased, and spaces and dashes get removed
- 4: build: string (tank build)
- 5: score: numberOrOp
- 6: runtime: numberOrOp, time spent alive in seconds
- 7: kills: numberOrOp
- 8: assists: numberOrOp
- 9: bosses: numberOrOp, boss kills or assists
- 10: polygons: numberOrOp, polygons destroyed
- 11: custom: numberOrOp, special "dread" kills
- 12: creation: date (unix timestamp or formatted date)
- 13: token: unsupported

**Command Examples:**
- `/find screenshot-count:>=1 score:<5.000.000`
- `/find tank-class:sniper runtime-seconds:>3600`
- `/find history-count:0 score:<200,000>1,000,000`
- `/find match-code:[score;>=1,000,000],[kills;<20]`
